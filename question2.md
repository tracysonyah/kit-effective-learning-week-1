Speed Reading--
This is an article written by Scott Young about the wrong idea people have(even he had) about speed reading. Speed reading experts or pretty much anybody who wants to or reads over 500 words per minute do it at a tradeoff of comprehension. The price you pay for reading like a miniac is the loss of understanding. And then it's not possible for your eye to move that fast says an eye moving expert Keith Rayner, because the area of the eye responsible for moving(the fovea) can only go as fast. In order to read from a book or page your eye should be fixed on the word to deeper process it; this is called fixation. Then it has to move from one word to another, from one point to another and then back again; this process is called saccade. Beacause the fovea follows these processes it's difficult to read at an inhumanly fast pace.

Speed reading experts claim they can get pass this by using a system that avoids the idea of saccade and make words appear in the same place on the screen, this system is called spritz. There's also something called subvocalization; this is the inner voice that reads along with you when you read. You can hear it whenever you read, and it starts out loud and you can later learn to silence it. Speed reading experts claim that if you can silence or get rid of subvocalization, it'll help you immensely in reading fast but truthfully speaking subvocalization helps you understand what you are reading so silencing it could do more harm than good.

Walking an daydreaming--
Daydreaming is very imortant in the world of creativity, To be a creative person, take a walk. To be creative, daydream. JK Rowling, the writer of Harry Porter said that when she daydreamed on the stucked train on the track in 1990 while others did other things, that was when the entire plot fell into her head. Because of that moment of just zoning out and relaxing, she got a billion dollar idea that changed her life forever. Everything that is Extraordinary about human works is set by the balance between the free and leisure time to just lazy around and do nothing(Andrew Smart, book:Autopilot; the power of doing nothing) and the time where you focus and concentrate to make things work.

Walking is also very important to learning, when you walk or jog, or even exercise, a gives way for biiger thoughts. It broadens and opens your mind. While walking with his dad, a little boy at the time got the idea of numbers and started to think about it. Walking is essential for learning, if you want to be creative take a walk. Relax, be stressfree and just lazy around sometimes, take a walk. And as unnecesary as this sounds, it really is effective and it worth a shot.

Procrastination--
Procrastination is evident among us everyday, when we try to learn something that we really don't want to, the area of our brain associated with pain is triggered, nobody wants to experience pain so we try and do something else that's way more "fun" and way less "painful". This is called procrastination, when you are learning something you really don't want to and decide to move to something more intriguing.



Try, try, and try again--
It's said that if at first you don't succeed, try try and try again. Not everyone is successful on their first trial of new things, Benny tried learning a language for 6ix months and failed miserably. He felt like giving up a million times but he kept going, he kept trying and trying again and again until he finally got a hang of it.
