Task 1
Given the situations i find myself, it'll be up to me now to learn these things in order to be more effective and of more importance to the company; I have to come up with some effective learning techniques to accomplish those things and achieve success. My first approah on the language side of things would be to follow the advice and example of BENNY THE IRISH POLYGOT and start to develop a love for the swedish culture and the language itself(I'm sure there are lots of things to love about the swedish culture) and the next step would be to imerse myself in the language and just start learning, not afraid of making mistakes but just learning and learning; And it would be especially helpful that'll be living alongside the locals from switzerland who primarily speaks Swiss german.

Learning a programming languages could also be considered as learning a new language but this will be more of writing(computerized) than speaking so it can also be taken as any other course to learn. Learning programming languages, understanding documentaries and even learning other languages; all of these can be learned using the focused and diffuse mode. You focus intently on the lessons under the course or the language you are trying to learn and try and try to get absorb it all; this is the focus mode, and then when you just can't seem to figure it out(could be the language or the documentry or just whatever it is you need to get a return offer) you go into your diffuse mode, In this mode you are just resting or doing something else that really don't require you using your brain much. And then in this leisure time, your brain takes the time to connect those dots and you'd be surprised that when you go back to the focus mode, you take whatever it is your brain came up with to the focus mode; and then you can compare and make sense of it because not all intuitions or ideas gotten in your diffuse mode are right.

These will be applicable to the situations i find myself and would be of great help. The ideas of the diffuse and focus mode gotten from my week 1 of learning effectively, the insight given by Dr. Terrence Sejnowski in the interview that when you can do something by yourself using your own brain it means you actually understands it. Applying the pomodoro technique of taking breaks every 25minutes could also be very helpful and aids your brain in the process. What also could be applicable to me in this given situation is the notes on strengthening a student's toolbox. I Could use the ten steps given to me in general to get a grasp of everything i'm trying to absorb but to actually understand i'm going to use the most effective ones like practice testing where oi test myself on things i've learned, distributed practice or better, interleaved practice e.t.c With my knowledge on Memory(Working memory and the permanent memory), Procrastination and many more. Learning new things will be really easy. I know that practices makes permanent so with all these tips and a hold lot of practice, i can make everything stick; make it permanent and get a return offer from the company of my dreams.


Task 2
A learning strategy for increasing my chances of getting a return offer and succeeding in everyday life in Zurich alonside the ones listed in the first task could be accepting the fact that this is the norm now and just imersing myself and absorbing as much as i can; like a sponge. I would first develop a schedule which is shown below on how to tackle of of this. ALmost everything said in week 1 could be a nice strategy for increasing your chances of grtting a return offer from the company. Some extra strategies could be exercising, taking a walk, jogging, having enough sleep to watch your brain free of toxins e.t.c and e.t.c which will all aid in the learning of those materials and enable me getting a return offer from the company.

Task 3
Now, how can this strategy be  implemented over 3 months given your official working hours are 8am-5:30pm from monday to friday, that's the big question. For three months i'm going to learning to both speak and write Swiss german alonside computer programming languages and also some documentries, readings and every other thing i need to know. So, i have 15 hours for the company and the rest of the hours of the day to myself which 6 hours. So ouside of work i'm going to use four hours each day to learn effectively. One hour 30mins for the foreign language(makes it easier since i'm in the same house as people from switzerland who also speaks the language i'm learning) 2 hours 20 minutes for everything else fot three months. ANd with everything i have to learn, i think it'll be best to do interleave practice(distributing mixed or different sets of topics over study or practice section).
